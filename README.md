Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a technique for NLP (Natural Language Processing) pre-training developed by Google. BERT was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google.[1][2] Google is leveraging BERT to better understand user searches.
In this work, to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset I used BERT tokenizer.
